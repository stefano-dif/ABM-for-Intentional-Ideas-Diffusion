# Using Agent-Based Modeling to Analyze Intentional Diffusion of Ideas

This paper presents a COCA-derived approach to study information diffusion in a network under the
action of an external influence. Our main interest is in determining under what conditions an influencing actor,
merely capable to induce public attention and not directly persuading, can obtain a shift in the populationâ€™s
distribution of opinions. We analyze the results under a wide range of starting conditions and derive implications
both for prediction of social contagion and for normative statements directed to "influencing agents" or
to those who wish to oppose them.
